# Synergy25-Deepfake-Challenge
A project to mimic the outputs of a proprietary deepfake detector for the Synergy'25 Hackathon.
Synergy'25 Deepfake Challenge: Predicting the DistributionThis repository contains the code and methodology for our submission to the Synergy’25 Deepfake Challenge. Our primary objective was to develop a model that accurately mimics the outputs of the provided proprietary deepfake detector.Key Insight & MethodologyOur initial data analysis revealed that the proprietary model was "imperfect," occasionally misclassifying both real and fake images. This became the central insight of our strategy: our goal was not to build a perfect detector, but to replicate the specific behavior—including the errors—of the target model.Our pipeline consisted of four main stages:Unified Data Preparation: We created a single master_labels.csv file that mapped all 2,000 training images to their true target labels as defined by the proprietary model's JSON predictions.Model Architecture: We used a ResNet18 model, pre-trained on ImageNet, which is highly effective for the 32x32 image size of the dataset.Robust Training: To combat overfitting and improve generalization, we implemented several regularization techniques: increased Dropout, Weight Decay, and Random Erasing augmentation.Prediction: The final, trained model was used to generate predictions on the 500 test images.How to Run the CodePrerequisitesPython 3.8+PyTorch & TorchvisionPandasScikit-learntqdmYou can install the dependencies with:pip install torch torchvision pandas scikit-learn tqdm
Data SetupDownload the official hackathon dataset.Unzip it into a folder named hackathon_dataset.Place this hackathon_dataset folder in the same root directory as the Python scripts.Execution OrderThe scripts must be run in the following order:1. Prepare the Data:This script creates the master_labels.csv file, which is required for training.python prepare_data.py
2. Train the Model:This script trains the ResNet18 model and saves the best-performing version as best_model_v2.pth.python train_model_v2.py
3. Generate Predictions:This script loads the trained model and generates the final teamname_prediction.json file.python predict_v2.py
Final ResultOur best model achieved a validation accuracy of [Enter Your Best Accuracy Here, e.g., 88.75%] on the held-out validation set.
